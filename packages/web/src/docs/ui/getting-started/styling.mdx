# Styling

The UI kit only uses `emotion` for the components. You can use any styling solution for your app. However, I encourage you to use `<Box />`
component to build your app. If you have ever use other libs like `Charka-UI` or `Tailwind` you might understand utility first.
Visit `<Box />` [document](/ui/getting-started/box) to learn about it.

All the component structures are build on `<Box />` component, so we can customize the component style directly.

If the style is common and reuse across the app please use `theme` in this case.

For the example we can change style directly to the `<Button />` component because they are build on `<Box />`

```tsx

// id, ml are  box props and they will add to the root element.
// Add box props to content element
// ml = margin-left
// pt = padding-top
<Button
	id="10"
	ml="50px"
	contentProps={{
		pt: "20px",
	}}
/>

```
