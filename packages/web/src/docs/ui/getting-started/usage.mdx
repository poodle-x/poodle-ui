# Usage

## Import

We can import at the root or by a specific path. However, it's better that we should import by a specific path.
Some build tools in your project might be outdated and does not smart about code-splitting, end up import everything
from the UI to your app.

```js

import ThemeProvider from "@poodle/ui/ThemeProvider";

// or

import { ThemeProvider } from "@poodle/ui";

```

## Provider

The `Poodle UI` need `ThemeProvider` to work correctly. Add `ThemeProvider` to the top level of your app.

You can add the `CSSReset` to your app.

Check [theming document](/ui/getting-started/theming) to see how can we use `ThemeProvider` to customize the global theme.

```jsx

import ThemeProvider from "@poodle/ui/ThemeProvider";
import CSSReset from "@poodle/ui/CSSReset";

export function AppProvider({ children }: { children?: React.ReactNode }) {
	return (
		<ThemeProvider>
			<CSSReset />
			{children}
		</ThemeProvider>
	);
}

// Your App entry
export function App() {
	<AppProvider>
		...
	</AppProvider>
}
```
